title: Key Takeaways from MISQ Reviewer Workshop
tags: research
---
Days ago, I attended a reviewer development workshop by MIS Quarterly. The workshop was very informative regarding how to be a responsible reviewer. <p>
A key component of this workshop is group discussion. I was very lucky to be assign to a group with two experienced Associate editors (Ling Xue from Georgia State Univeristy and Nachi Sahoo from Boston University), and Jiyong Park from UNCG. The one-hour group discussion was super beneficial and I feel I'm obligated to summarize the comments and suggests shared by Ling and Nachi. Hopefully, the key takeaways will be resonant and helpful. <p>
The first and foremost is to engage in a communication during the review process.
Such a conversational mentality is beyond a writing style. It is to be more specific and concise when providing review comments (e.g., confusions about theoretical concepts and positioning, or questions about empirical issues). Be clear about what are expected and avoid mis-communication between reviewers and the authors. It is also to utilize the viable channel to communicate thoughts with the editors. It will be helpuful to build the common ground especially when reviewers have sharply different views from the editors or see a new issue in a higher-round of review. Be thoughtful and avoid surprising major comments at a later-round of reviews. <p> 

Second, although judging the theoretical contribution is subjective, the ultimate criterion is to see whether a paper advances our understanding of theories and/or relationships between theoretical concepts. One of the questions discussed is about new settings/contexts. What makes a paper with significant theoretical contributions is not about the specific context itself, but whether the context makes current theories different or invalid and whether this paper has revised/expanded the theories. <p>

Third, we also discussed how to provide comments on the endogeneity issue. It will be helpful for reviewers to jump out of the box of viewing the endogeneity issue as a pure empirical/technical issue. Instead, reviewers still need to link back to the theoretical value of the paper. A great reviewer can make the tradeoff between theoretical contributions and empirical challenges.
