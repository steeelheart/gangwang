title: Key Takeaways from MISQ Reviewer Workshop
tags: research
---
Days ago, I attended a reviewer development workshop by MIS Quarterly. The workshop was very informative regarding how to be a responsible reviewer. <p>
A key component of this workshop is group discussion. I was very lucky to be assign to a group with two experienced Associate editors (Ling Xue from Georgia State Univeristy and Nachi Sahoo from Boston University), and Jiyong Park from UNCG. The one-hour group discussion was super beneficial and I feel I'm obligated to summarize the comments and suggests shared by Ling and Nachi. Hopefully, the key takeaways will be resonant and helpful. <p>
